# CarParkingLot_OOP

I created this car parking lot project to get practice with the OOP concepts using python.

The project consists of the following:


There are 20 spots available in the parking lot,
it costs 5 dollars an hour to park your car. 
If your car has been parked for over 20 hours you will be charged an extra $100

Two classes:

# Car class

- Constructor with information about the car

# Garage class

- Displays spots availables on Garage

- Add cars to Garage

- Remove cars from garage

- Show cars of garage

- bills the person
